# React memory game 
(https://rmaharja.github.io/react_image_click_game/)

This project is a simple memory game built using React, using Materialize CSS as the primary CSS framework.  The game uses twelve images of our favorite characters from our favorite cartoon shows including a Sponge who lives under the sea and cowardly dog names Courage.  

### Game instructions:
1.) Click on one of the images to start the game!
2.) After the first image is clicked, the order of the images will be shuffled.
3.) Scroll down to find the rest of the images and click each of the images only once to win the game! 
4.) Click the same image twice and you lose! (Don't feel bad it's only a game...Although my 7 year old niece beat it in the first try)
5.) Enjoy :)

### Want to play it locally?
1.) Clone the repo to your local drive.
2.) After the repo is cloned, install the dependencies. (NPM install or Yarn install).
3.) After the local dependencies are installed, enter "Yarn start or NPM start" in the command line from the root of the repo.
4.) The game should run on your localhost:3000
5.) Ejoy :)
